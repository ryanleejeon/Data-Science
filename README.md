# Data Science Projects:

### 1) Time Series of Analysis of Heat Treated Swine
◦ **Leadership:** Directed and managed a team of undergraduates on bimonthly six hour road trips during the summer, to an off campus swine research site for the setup of pigs and environmental sensors for the collection of environmental time series data. 

◦ **Data Collection:** Created a polished time series dataset by pre-processing data and imputing missing values.

◦ **Time Series Analysis:** Conducted the method of least-squares on R to statistically determine the impact of hot
air temperature on six different body parts of the pig, for three different pig body weight groups, on two different pig housing conditions, over four different periods of time.
  
  Here is a plot to illustrate a small part of the time series data I was working with

### 2. Genetic Indicators for Swine Fitness and Body Condition under Stress 
◦ **Correlations between Swine Fitness and Genetics:** Implemented statistical techniques on R to a large immunology dataset to demonstrate that a genetic mutation in swine was significantly associated with higher fitness, body fat percentage, resilience, and health status in pigs.

Here is an example of some code I ran to show that a particular genotype (combinatination of alleles) in the WUR gene was associated with higher weight gain in pigs:

◦ **Heritability of Swine Fitness:** Collaborated with a team to estimate the heritability of over 100 physiological traits in pigs to determine the genetic correlation between disease traits and immune cell proliferation from a novel mitogen stimulation assay. *Heritability is estimated from the regression of offspring phenotype on the average phenotype of the parents*

Here is an example figure from my Masters dissertation on calculating heritability of certain traits

## Side Projects
• **LivestockCV:** Published an open source python library for those new to computer vision, undergraduates, veterinarians or animal scientists who wish to implement computer vision strategies on image and video of livestock animals.

• **Apple Watch Body Fat Percentage Tracker:** Visualization of body fat percent changes over a year, regressed against aggregated monthly averages of cardio using the Apple Watch API. Determined through a correlation matrix that increased cardio was associated with decreased body fat percentage. Developed code to further analyze personal cardiovascular activity recognition and classification over different sports and activities. Below is a correlation matrix I made using some fitness variables as well as two synthetic variables I created.

• **Web Scraping Indeed.com:** Developed a user defined function to web scrape Indeed.com for specified jobs, locations, and important keywords. Outputs a .csv file of the job title, company name, job description, and the indeed.com job posting URL of the first 200 job entries. The job descriptions were further parsed using NLTK to remove stop words and output a histogram of the top twenty most frequently used words in the job description. Below is the histogram.

• **Automated Piglet Wellbeing Dashboard:** Designed an computer vision based HVAC control dashboard for regulating ideal piglet temperatures on C++ using a PixyCam sensor and various different environmental sensors to prevent heat stress by holistically regulating the overall condition of the piglet. Increased temperatures and humidity would turn on an AC unit, while decreased temperatures would turn on a central heating pad for the piglets.

Here is a schematic of the Arduino hardware that I built.

• **Automated Fashion Color Palette:** Currently developing a sports fashion data mining program that can data mine different types of shoes from Nike and Adidas to output a color palette of each new shoe using KMeans clustering. Then this program will output a frequency plot to show based on the collected data, which colors are most used, to qualitatively answer the question, which colors are now in style for the season. Results are surprisingly different depending on the type of shoe (basketball vs cleats vs boots), season, and gender). Here are two barplots I created just from mining the Nike website. You can see that the colors most common in cleats are brighter from those in skateboarding shoes, which I thought used more muted colors.
